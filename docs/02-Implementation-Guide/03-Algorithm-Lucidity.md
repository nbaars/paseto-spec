# Algorithm Lucidity

Algorithm Lucidity refers to resilience against algorithm confusion attacks.

This document aims to make it easy for PASETO implementations to achieve this property.

## PASETO Cryptography Key Requirements

Cryptography keys in PASETO are defined as **both the raw key material and its
parameter choices, not just the raw key material**.

PASETO implementations **MUST** enforce some logical separation between different key types;
especially when the raw key material is the same (i.e. a 256-bit opaque blob).

Arbitrary strings (or byte arrays, or equivalent language constructs) **MUST NOT**
be accepted as a key in any PASETO library, **UNLESS** it's an application-specific
encoding that encapsulates both the key and an algorithm identifier. (For example,
a [`k2.local` PASERK](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paserk/blob/master/types/local.md).)

## Implementation Guidance

### Object-Oriented Languages

Strict type separation should be employed in object-oriented languages.

* For local tokens, you only need a `SymmetricKey`.
* For public tokens, you need an `AsymmetricSecretKey` and an `AsymmetricPublicKey`.

Each key type should be parametrized by two inputs: The key material and an algorithm identifier.

For example, you might implement something like this:

```java
public enum Version { V1, V2, V3, V4 };
public enum Purpose { PURPOSE_LOCAL, PURPOSE_PUBLIC }; 

absract class Key {
     protected byte[] material;
     protected Version version;
     
     public Key(byte[] keyMaterial, Version version) {
     }
     
     abstract public bool isKeyValidFor(Version v, Purpose p);
     
     /* ... */
}

class SymmetricKey extends Key {
    public SymmetricKey(byte[] keyMaterial, Version version) {
        super(keyMaterial, version);
    }
    
    public bool isKeyValidFor(Version v, Purpose p) {
        return v == this.version && p == Purpose.PURPOSE_LOCAL;
    }
}
class AsymmetricSecretKey extends Key {
    public AsymmetricSecretKey(byte[] keyMaterial, Version version) {
        super(keyMaterial, version);
    }
    
    public bool isKeyValidFor(Version v, Purpose p) {
        return v == this.version && p == Purpose.PURPOSE_PUBLIC;
    }
}
class AsymmetricPublicKey extends Key {
    public AsymmetricPublicKey(byte[] keyMaterial, Version version) {
        super(keyMaterial, version);
    }
    
    public bool isKeyValidFor(Version v, Purpose p) {
        return v == this.version && p == Purpose.PURPOSE_PUBLIC;
    }
}
```

Whenever you implement one of the PASETO operations, you would then first invoke
`givenKey.isKeyValidFor()` for the expected version and purpose. If it doesn't
return true, throw an `Exception`.

### Procedural Languages

If you're working in a procedural programming language, where the concept of classes isn't
available to lean on, the algorithm identifier should be hard-coded alongside the key material
(e.g. in a `struct` or a header attached to the key material in memory) and checked by the 
library.

Here's a rough pseudocode example for the C programming language:

```c
#include "sodium.h"

typedef enum { V3_LOCAL, V3_LOCAL, V3_PUBLIC };

unsigned char* paseto_v3_local_keygen() {
    unsigned char out[33];
    out[0] = (unsigned char) V3_LOCAL & 0xff;
    randombytes_buf(out + 1, 32);
    return out;
}
unsigned char* paseto_v4_local_keygen() {
    unsigned char out[33];
    out[0] = (unsigned char) V4_LOCAL & 0xff;
    randombytes_buf(out + 1, 32);
    return out;
}
unsigned char* paseto_v4_public_keygen() {
    unsigned char out[65];
    unsigned char tmp[32];
    out[0] = (unsigned char) V4_PUBLIC & 0xff;
    crypto_sign_keypair(tmp, out + 1);
    return out;
}
```

And then when processing a token:

```c
int paseto_v4_local_decrypt(unsigned char* out, const unsigned char* in, const unsigned char* key) {
    if (key[0] != V4_LOCAL) {
        return -1; /* Wrong version or purpose */
    }
}  
```

## Why This Matters

PASETO largely obviates the risk of algorithm confusion attacks by design. It accomplishes
this by limiting the in-band negotiation to the bare minimum:

* What version are you using?
* Are you expecting a `local` or `public` token?

However, PASETO implementations that allow the incorrect key to be used for a given algorithm
may open themselves up to attack.

By enforcing Algorithm Lucidity, the libraries that implement PASETO (and the applications that
depend on those libraries) can boast a stronger misuse-resistance story.

The absence of this property isn't a vulnerability, because there may be other mitigating factors
at play. 

For example: If the keys are used in totally disparate code paths, and there is no potential for
a Confused Deputy in the implementation's architecture (n.b., any high-level user-facing API that 
switches between the disparate back-end code paths), then the absence of Algorithm Lucidity cannot
cause a security vulnerability.

However, the moment someone comes along and makes said implementation more user-friendly, the
assumptions that made this *safe* are invalidated. It's also not great to have to decide between
security and convenience.

The simple solution to that whole conundrum is: **Always implement Algorithm Lucidity in PASETO
libraries, and feel free to make your API as user-friendly as possible.**
